                  With the help of allies Lt. Jim Gordon and DA Harvey Dent , Batman has

                  been able to keep a tight lid on crime in Gotham City. But when a vile young criminal calling himself
                  the Joker

                  suddenly throws the town into chaos, the caped Crusader begins to tread a fine line between heroism
                  and

                  vigilantism

                        It has been eight years since Batman , in collusion with Commissioner Gordon, vanished

                        into the night. Assuming responsibility for the death of Harvey Dent, Batman sacrificed
                        everything for what he and

                        Gordon hoped would be the greater good. However, the arrival of a cunning cat burglar and a
                        merciless

                        terrorist named Bane force Batman out of exile and into a battle he may not be able to win.
